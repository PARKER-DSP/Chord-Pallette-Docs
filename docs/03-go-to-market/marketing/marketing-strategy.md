# Go-to-Market Strategy

Combined marketing and sales strategy for ChordPallette's launch and growth.

---

## Positioning

**ChordPallette** is a performance-driven chord capture + voicing instrument that makes progressions **flow**.

## Primary Angles

- **Speed** – Capture and reuse chord moments instantly
- **Quality** – Voicings that sound finished, less mud
- **Performance** – Trigger banks like an instrument
- **Flow** – Voice leading makes transitions musical

---

## Channels

### Content-First (Phase 0-1)

- **YouTube Shorts** – Fast, visual workflow demos (capture → voice → play)
- **Instagram/TikTok** – Music creator clips showing before/after progressions
- **Producer Discords** – Authentic community presence
- **Micro-influencer Affiliates** – Seeded demos with trusted producers

### Launch Phase (Phase 2-3)

- **Landing page** + email capture
- **Weekly demo clips** building toward release
- **Beta user recruitment** (20-50 focused users)
- **Testimonials & case studies** from early adopters
- **Affiliate partnerships** at launch

### Growth Phase (Phase  3-5)

- **Product ecosystem** (operator packs, voicing packs, controller profiles)
- **Content marketing** – voice leading tutorials, harmony education
- **Community UGC** – user-shared chord banks and templates
- **Email nurture** – product updates, tips, new content drops

## Target Early Adopter Profile

2. **Voice with Intent** – Professional voicings and smart auto-adjustments
3. **Play in Real Time** – Trigger sophisticated chords live with expression and feel
4. **Understand the Why** – Learn voice-leading rules through hands-on experimentation
