# Investor Pitch

ChordPallette: A performance-driven chord capture and voicing instrument for producers and musicians.

---

## The Problem

Producers want better harmony fast, but current chord tools are often:
- **Theory-heavy** – Requiring deep music knowledge to get value
- **Slow** – Time-consuming manual voicing and adjustment
- **Not performance-oriented** – Built for composition, not live triggering
- **Trapped solutions** – Hard to remember and reuse great voicings

**Result:** Creators spend hours voicing, lose creative momentum, and resort to generic preset banks.

---

## The Solution

**ChordPallette** is a real-time chord capture and voicing instrument that:

1. **Captures** harmony instantly from MIDI (one gesture)
2. **Modifies** chords non-destructively (voicing, range, operators)
3. **Performs** with sophisticated voice leading (smooth, musical transitions)
4. **Organizes** chord banks with metadata, search, and export

**Key Innovation:** Voice leading algorithm that makes chord progressions sound connected and intentional, without requiring theory knowledge.

---

## Why Now

- **Creator economy booming** – Music production tools are hot
- **MIDI workflow standard** – Producers expect seamless plugin integration
- **Performance-focused music** – Live, real-time expression matters as much as composition
- **AI tools building momentum** – Educational + creative AI is in demand
- **Pricing power growing** – Creators will pay for specialized, high-quality tools
