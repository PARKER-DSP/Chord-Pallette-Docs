# Guidelines Overview

This section defines how to contribute to the ChordPallette docs repository with consistent structure, tone, and quality.

## Read Order

1. [Documentation Style Guide](documentation-style-guide.md)
2. [Documentation Creation Guide](ChordPallette_Documentation_Creation_Guide.md)
3. [Invariants](invariants.md)
4. [AI Agent Rules](ai-agent-rules.md)
5. [Pro Commit Guidelines](pro-commit-guidelines.md)

## Working Principles

- Keep pages human-readable first.
- Keep concerns separated (foundation, feature, architecture, UX, GTM, archive).
- Link to canonical pages instead of duplicating concepts.
- Treat archive and intake docs as context, not source of truth.

- [Playability Overlays Spec](../architecture/playability-overlays-spec.md)
