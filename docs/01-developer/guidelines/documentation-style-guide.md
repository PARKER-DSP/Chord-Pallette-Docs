# Documentation Style Guide

Use a professional, concise, and evidence-oriented tone.

## Required metadata

All canonical docs should include frontmatter with:

- `audience`
- `status` (`canonical`, `draft`, `archived`)
- `owner`
- `last_reviewed` (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Voice and tone by document type

### Technical specification
- Use precise, testable language.
- Define invariants, interfaces, and failure modes.
- Avoid marketing adjectives and unsupported claims.

### Onboarding / how-to
- Use direct imperative steps.
- Include prerequisites and expected outcomes.
- Keep examples runnable and scoped.

### Marketing strategy
- State audience segment, channel, hypothesis, and metric.
- Distinguish assumptions from validated data.
- Keep positioning language consistent with product foundation docs.

### Sales collateral
- Focus on customer outcomes and proof points.
- Keep claims traceable to product capabilities.
- Avoid speculative promises.

## Linking conventions

- Use relative links for internal pages.
- Link to canonical pages only.
- For legacy context, link through [Archive](../../archive/index.md).
