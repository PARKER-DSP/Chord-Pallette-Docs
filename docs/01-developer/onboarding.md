# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to ChordPallette development.

## First Steps

1. Read **Architecture Overview** and **Current Baseline**.
2. Review **Invariants**, **AI Agent Rules**, and **Code Style**.
3. Skim **Feature Guide Introduction** and relevant feature docs.
4. Confirm your branch and commit workflow via **Pro Commit Guidelines**.

## Ongoing Workflow

- Keep changes aligned with module boundaries and realtime safety constraints.
- Update docs alongside code changes.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits with clear intent.
