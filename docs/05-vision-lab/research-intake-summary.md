# Research Intake Summary

This page summarizes material ingested from:

- `docs/stuff to consider`
- `docs to incorporate/2. OLD DOCUMENTS`

It records what was promoted into canonical docs and what remains intake-only.

## Promoted Into Canonical Docs

- Thread ownership and lifecycle model:
  - [Threading and Lifecycle](../01-developer/architecture/threading-and-lifecycle.md)
- Bank-level overlay semantics (Up, Down, Steady, Original):
  - [Playability Overlays Spec](../01-developer/architecture/playability-overlays-spec.md)
- Docs workflow standard with explicit agentic flow:
  - [Documentation Creation Guide](../01-developer/guidelines/ChordPallette_Documentation_Creation_Guide.md)
  - [AI Agent Rules](../01-developer/guidelines/ai-agent-rules.md)

## Intake-Only Sources (Not Canonical)

- raw prompt artifacts:
  - `docs/stuff to consider/deep-research-report2.md`
  - `docs/stuff to consider/deep-research-report3.md`
  - `docs/stuff to consider/deep-research-report4.md`
- long-form brainstorming transcript:
  - `docs/stuff to consider/voice leading algorithim idea.txt`

These remain useful as ideation context but are not canonical reference docs.

## Guidance for Future Intake

1. keep raw notes in intake/archive locations
2. extract durable decisions into canonical pages
3. link canonical pages back to source intake summary
