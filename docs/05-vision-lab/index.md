# Vision Lab

Vision Lab is the canonical home for experimental concepts that are not yet committed to roadmap delivery.

## Purpose

This section protects creative exploration while keeping canonical implementation docs stable.

Use Vision Lab for:

- moonshot feature ideas
- speculative UX directions
- research hypotheses that require feasibility checks

## Graduation Rule

A concept moves from Vision Lab to canonical feature or architecture docs only after:

1. feasibility analysis
2. realtime safety assessment
3. clear user value statement
4. explicit owner and implementation path
