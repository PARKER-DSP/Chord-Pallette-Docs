# Moonshots

These long-horizon ideas are intentionally ambitious and must pass feasibility review before entering the feature roadmap.

## Candidate Concepts

1. Harmonic gravity engine for progression-level tension arcs.
2. Adaptive register intelligence based on arrangement density.
3. Emotion macro that steers motion, spacing, and tension profile.
4. Context-aware reharmonization suggestions with continuity constraints.
5. Visual voice-leading map for explainability and education.
6. MIDI 2.0 expressive harmony mode.
7. "Capture the magic" jam detection and highlight flow.
8. Performance surface mode for stage-first operation.
9. Genre DNA profiles based on curated style fingerprints.
10. Harmonic evolution mode for controlled variation over repeats.
