# 🎹 Voice Leading — The Secret to Chords That *Flow*

You don’t just want chords.  
You want movement.

You trigger a progression…  
But instead of sounding connected, it jumps.  
Blocky. Mechanical. MIDI.

Voice Leading fixes that.

---

## What It Does

Voice Leading intelligently connects one chord to the next by smoothly moving each note to the closest, most musical destination.

Instead of:

Cmaj7 → Fmaj7  
(notes jumping awkwardly across octaves)

You get:

Cmaj7 → Fmaj7  
(notes sliding naturally, shared tones preserved, bass grounded)

The result?

✨ Chords that breathe  
✨ Transitions that feel intentional  
✨ Progressions that tell a story

## Why It Matters

Great harmony isn’t just about *what* chord comes next.

It’s about *how* it gets there.

Film composers use it.  
Neo-soul players rely on it.  
Classical composers mastered it centuries ago.  

Now it’s built directly into your performance workflow.

## Designed for Live Creativity

Voice Leading works **in real time**.

Trigger chords in any order.  
Jump around your bank.  
Improvise.

The plugin listens to what just played and adjusts the next chord to connect smoothly.

No setup.  
No theory knowledge required.  
Just better movement.

## Choose the Feel

Voice Leading includes style profiles to match your sound:

**Smooth**  
Natural, minimal motion. Perfect for songwriting.

**Cinematic**  
Wide emotional movement with lyrical top lines.

**Neo-Soul**  
Clustered upper voices and silky bass stability.

**Classical**  
Structured motion with disciplined voice control.

**EDM Stack**  
Big spreads, stable low end, powerful upper motion.

Each style gives your progression a distinct personality.

## Non-Destructive & Flexible

Voice Leading never changes your original chords.

You can:
- Toggle it on or off instantly
- Override it per chord
- Freeze the result when you love it
- Export either the original or voice-led version

Total creative control. Zero risk.

## The Difference You Hear

Without Voice Leading:
> Chords switch.

With Voice Leading:
> Harmony evolves.

It’s the difference between:
- A preset machine
- And a musical instrument

---

## The Big Idea

Voice Leading turns your chord bank into a living harmonic engine.

Instead of static blocks…

You get:

🎼 Motion  
🎼 Continuity  
🎼 Emotion  

Because storytelling in music doesn’t happen in the chord.  
It happens in the transition.
