# What is ChordPallette?

ChordPallette is a **performance-driven chord capture and voicing instrument** for music producers.

It lets you:
- capture chords from MIDI input/playback (and optionally audio)
- store them as **triggerable chord blocks** in banks
- apply **non-destructive chord operators** (voicing, rhythm, humanize, etc.)
- apply bank-wide output rules (playable range, folding/culling, etc.)
- trigger and perform chords live with intelligent transitions (e.g., voice leading)

## The promise
Turn chords you already love into a **playable instrument** — fast, musical, and modern.
