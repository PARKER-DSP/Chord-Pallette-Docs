# Investor Pitch (starter)

## Problem
Producers want better harmony fast, but chord tools are often theory-heavy, slow, and not performance-oriented.

## Solution
ChordPallette: capture + modify + perform chord banks with non-destructive operators and voice leading.

## Why now
Creators want faster workflows; MIDI tools are booming; modern producers buy “speed + vibe”.

## Go-to-market
Content demos + micro-influencers + affiliates + genre packs.

## Expansion
Operator packs, voicing packs, instrument profiles, potential mobile companion.
