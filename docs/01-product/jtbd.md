# Jobs To Be Done (starter)

- When I find a chord moment I like, I want to **capture it instantly** so I can reuse it later.
- When my progression sounds blocky, I want it to **flow naturally** so it feels professional.
- When a chord is too muddy, I want it to **auto-fit my playable range** without destroying the idea.
