# Start Here

Use this page to choose the right onboarding path and avoid outdated material.

## In this section

1. Read the [Product Overview](00-foundation/product-overview.md).
2. Review [How to Use These Docs](00-foundation/how-to-use-these-docs.md).
3. Pick an onboarding path:
   - [Human Developer Path](01-developer/onboarding/human-developer-path.md)
   - [AI Agent Path](01-developer/onboarding/ai-agent-path.md)

## Canonical documentation policy

- Treat pages outside the main navigation as non-authoritative unless explicitly linked from a canonical section.
- Use the [Archive](archive/index.md) only for historical reference.
- Use [Vision Lab](05-vision-lab/index.md) for experimental concepts that are not committed roadmap work.
