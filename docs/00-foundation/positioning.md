# Product Positioning

> **Status**: Draft positioning. Refined after Phase 1 customer interviews.

---

## Core Positioning Statement

**ChordPallette** is a performance-driven chord capture and voicing instrument that lets producers instantly collect, refine, and trigger playable chord blocks directly from MIDI.

**What this means:**
- **Performance-driven**: Designed for real-time creative work, not offline batch processing
- **Chord capture**: Save harmonic ideas with one interaction
- **Voicing instrument**: Not just a chord dictionary; active refinement and transformation
- **Playable chord blocks**: Not individual notes; full voiced chords for immediate musicality
- **From MIDI**: Native integration with DAW and keyboard workflows

---

## North-Star Taglines

**Final Choice (TBD after Phase 1):**
- *Capture • Shape • Play* – Emphasizes workflow
- *Chords that flow* – Emphasizes voice leading
- *Turn progressions into an instrument* – Emphasizes playability

---

## Differentiation vs. Alternatives

### vs. Piano Roll Voice-Leading (Manual)
**ChordPallette:** Automated voice-leading suggestions + one-click capture  
**Manual approach:** Full creative control but time-intensive

### vs. Chord Pack Preset Browsers
**ChordPallette:** Personalized library + smart range adaptation  
**Preset browsers:** Large collection but generic, one-size-fits-all

### vs. Music Theory Tools (Scaler, Hookpad)
**ChordPallette:** Focus on voice leading + playability, not scale/theory education  
**Theory tools:** Educational first; voicing is secondary feature

### vs. DAW Native Chord Features
**ChordPallette:** Dedicated, performant, live-expression capable  
**Native DAW chords:** Basic and limited to MIDI region constraints

## Brand Attributes

- **Precise, not precious** – Professional tool; skips the fluff
- **Flow-oriented** – Smooth, natural harmonic movement matters
- **Performer-focused** – Built for real-time, not just composition
- **Theory-informed but not theory-heavy** – Science behind the art, not art behind the science

---

## Target Early Adopter Profile

**Who:** Intermediate+ producers/keys players in electronic, hip-hop, and contemporary songwriting  
**Where:** DAWs (Ableton, FL, Logic); hardware keyboard workflows  
**Why:** Already invest in tools; care about harmony; feel friction from manual voicing  
**When:** When they hit the "my chords don't flow" or "I keep forgetting great voicings" problem

---

## Market Position

**Category:** Music production software / Performance instrument  
**Positioning:** Premium/specialized (not general purpose)  
**Price Tier:** Will determine based on Phase 1 research (estimated $50-200/year or per-license)

**Narrowness Advantage:** Deep focus on chord voicing, not general music theory tool box

---

## Messaging Pillars

1. **Capture Your Ideas** – From moment of inspiration to organized library, one gesture
2. **Voice with Intent** – Professional voicings and smart auto-adjustments, your way
3. **Play in Real Time** – Trigger sophisticated chords live with expression and feel
4. **Understand the Why** – Learn voice-leading rules through hands-on experimentation

---

## Success Indicator

**ChordPallette succeeds when:**
- Musicians stop manually voicing chords and start using the tool instinctively
- The voice-leading algorithm becomes part of the creative feedback loop (not just a fix)
- Users build personal chord libraries they return to across projects
- Performers rely on it for live triggering

## Open Questions (Phase 1 Validation)

1. Should positioning emphasize **capture** (efficiency) or **voicing** (quality)?
2. Is the target **live performers** or **studio producers**? (Different GTM)
3. How much **voice leading education** should/shouldn't be in the product?
4. Is **range/voicing optimization** the hero feature or supporting feature?
5. What's the right **price/revenue model**? (One-time, subscription, per-feature)
