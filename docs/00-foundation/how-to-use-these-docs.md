# How to Use These Docs

This documentation is organized by audience and by stage of work.

- **Start Here** for shared context and orientation.
- **Product Foundation** for strategy, JTBD, and positioning.
- **Feature Guide** for feature-level product and UX behavior.
- **Developer Guide** for architecture and engineering rules.
- **UX & Design** for interface and interaction guidance.
- **Go-to-Market** for launch, messaging, and sales enablement.

If you are new to the project, read **Product Overview** first, then use **Reading Paths** to select a tailored path.
