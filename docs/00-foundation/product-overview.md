# Product Foundation Overview

Welcome to ChordPallette's product foundation documentation. This section contains the strategic and contextual information that guides all development, design, and go-to-market decisions.

---

## What's Here

- **[Jobs To Be Done](jtbd.md)** – The human needs and problems ChordPallette solves, mapped to development phases and success metrics
- **[Target Personas](personas.md)** – Detailed profiles of who we're building for (producers, performers, songwriters, students, team)
- **[Product Positioning](positioning.md)** – Market positioning, differentiation, and messaging pillars

---

## Current Status: Foundation Phase (Phase 0)

We are in **pre-launch preparation**. Only the documentation system is in place. Our focus is on:

✅ **Complete**
- Documentation infrastructure
- JTBD analysis (detailed, granular)
- Starter personas and positioning

🟡 **In Progress**
- Persona validation through interviews
- Market position refinement
- MVP scope definition

⏳ **Next Steps (Phase 1)**
- Technical architecture finalization
- Voice leading algorithm research
- Developer team expansion (if applicable)
- Phase 1 roadmap execution

---

## How to Use This Section

**For Product Managers:**
- Start with [Jobs To Be Done](jtbd.md) to understand scope and phasing
- Review [Personas](personas.md) for feature prioritization
- Use [Positioning](positioning.md) to guide GTM decisions

**For Engineers / Architects:**
- Read [JTBD](jtbd.md#-jobs-by-development-phase) section on phasing
- Reference [Personas](personas.md) when making tradeoff decisions (e.g., Producer vs. Keys Player priorities)
- Check [Positioning](positioning.md) for non-functional requirements and user expectations

**For Marketing / Sales:**
- Study [Personas](personas.md) for messaging and channel strategy
- Use [Positioning](positioning.md) for copy and competitive positioning
- Reference [JTBD](jtbd.md#-success-metrics-future) for success metrics and launch readiness criteria

**For New Team Members:**
- Start here for product context
- Then read the [Technical Architecture](../01-developer/architecture/) to understand the system
- Review [Development Guidelines](../01-developer/guidelines/) for contribution practices

## Key Principles

1. **Jobs-First Thinking** – Features are evaluated against the 10 core jobs we're solving, not by feature count
2. **Phased Development** – We intentionally defer complex features (realtime playback) to later phases
3. **Persona Diversity** – Different personas want different things; we design for the primary persona first but don't ignore secondary personas
4. **Voice Leading Focus** – The core innovation is sophisticated voice leading; everything else is enabler
5. **Learning Through Doing** – Customers should understand harmonic principles while using the product
