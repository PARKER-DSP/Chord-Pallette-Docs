# Dream: <Feature Name>

Status: Experimental  
Horizon: Near / Mid / Long Term  
RT Feasibility: Low Risk / High Risk / Unknown  
Engineering Complexity: Low / Medium / High / Extreme

## The Vision

Describe the magical outcome.

What would the user experience feel like?

---

## Why It Would Be Magical

- Emotional payoff
- Creative acceleration
- Competitive differentiation
- “Wow” moment

---

## Musical Benefit

Explain in musical terms:
- What problem does this solve?
- What becomes easier?
- What becomes more expressive?

---

## User Story

Persona → Context → Friction → Delight → Measurable outcome.

---

## Technical Considerations

- Core impact
- Algorithm complexity
- Caching implications
- Serialization implications
- Plugin compatibility implications

---

## RT Risk Assessment

- Does this affect the audio thread?
- Is computation bounded?
- What must be precomputed?
- What must move off-thread?

---

## Smallest Testable Version (MVP Slice)

If we had to test this cheaply, what’s the smallest version?

---

## Signals to Watch

What would validate this idea?
- User behavior
- Beta feedback
- Performance metrics
- Market response

---

## Promotion Criteria

What would have to be true before this moves into:
- Feature Guide
- Active Roadmap
- Implementation
