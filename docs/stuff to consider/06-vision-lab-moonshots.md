# Moonshot Ideas (Seed Concepts)

These are bold, long-horizon ideas intended to stretch product imagination.

---

## 1️⃣ Harmonic Gravity Engine

A system that models tonal gravity and emotional direction over time.

Instead of just voice leading between adjacent chords, the engine predicts harmonic tension arcs across a full progression.

Magical outcome:
- Chords feel narratively intentional.
- Users can dial “resolve harder” or “float longer.”

---

## 2️⃣ Real-Time Adaptive Register Intelligence

The plugin learns the current track context (bass density, pad layering) and dynamically avoids frequency conflicts.

Magical outcome:
- Voicings automatically avoid mud in dense mixes.
- Pads stay airy even in complex sessions.

---

## 3️⃣ Emotion Dial (Energy ↔ Intimacy)

A single macro control that biases:
- Range width
- Tension allowance
- Motion size
- Harmonic density

Magical outcome:
- Users shape entire progressions emotionally with one gesture.

---

## 4️⃣ Context-Aware Reharmonization Suggestions

Based on the current progression, suggest alternate chords that maintain voice leading smoothness but increase interest.

Magical outcome:
- Users discover richer harmony without theory deep dives.

---

## 5️⃣ Visual Voice-Leading Map

A visual representation of motion vectors between chord blocks.

Magical outcome:
- Users see harmonic motion as flowing shapes.
- Teaching + creativity tool combined.

---

## 6️⃣ MIDI 2.0 Expressive Harmony Mode

Voice leading that adapts per-note expression (pitch bend, poly pressure, timbre).

Magical outcome:
- Harmony becomes dynamic and expressive per voice.

---

## 7️⃣ AI-Assisted “Capture the Magic” Mode

When users jam, the engine detects emotionally strong voicings and flags them for capture.

Magical outcome:
- Users never lose a magical moment.

---

## 8️⃣ Performance Surface Mode

Minimal UI view for live players:
- Large chord blocks
- Directional overlays
- Energy macro
- Capture button

Magical outcome:
- Feels like an instrument, not software.

---

## 9️⃣ Genre DNA Profiles

Profiles built from analyzing real-world chord usage patterns in specific genres.

Magical outcome:
- Authentic stylistic voicing without manual tweaking.

---

## 🔟 Harmonic Evolution Mode

Gradually evolve voicing shape across repeated chord triggers.

Magical outcome:
- Static loops feel alive without manual automation.

---

# Important

These ideas are intentionally ambitious.

They must pass:
- RT safety constraints
- UX clarity filter
- Differentiation test
- Feasibility analysis

Only then may they graduate from Moonshot → Spec.
