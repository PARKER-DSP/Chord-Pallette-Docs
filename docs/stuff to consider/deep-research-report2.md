{"prompt":"You are an expert research analyst + product strategist + realtime-audio/MIDI software architect. Do deep research + propose a prototype plan for voice-leading algorithms for ChordPallette (MIDI-first harmony plugin). Use the current project docs as context: https://github.com/PARKER-DSP/Chord-Pallette-Docs . Use ONLY high-quality primary sources (papers, standards/specs, official dev docs, reputable audio-dev blogs). For EVERY non-obvious claim, put a URL citation immediately next to it. Separate clearly: FACTS (with prioritized sources) vs INFERENCES/RECOMMENDATIONS; label ASSUMPTIONS (target CPU/latency budget, host list, max voices are unspecified). Write an expository, rigorous report starting with an Executive Summary. Cover: algorithm survey (DP/Viterbi, constraint programming, heuristic search/A*, Tymoczko voice-leading geometry); bounded candidate generation strategies; style-profiled cost functions (neo-soul, cinematic, worship, R&B) with templates, parameter ranges, and musical rationale; deterministic RT-safe implementations (allocation-free, preallocated pools, lock-free queues, off-thread prep); per-voice identity (voice tracking) and MPE/MIDI2 considerations; candidate pruning heuristics; evaluation metrics and golden-MIDI fixture design; property-based testing + fuzzing approach; complexity and worst-case bounds. Include: (1) recommended v1 algorithm(s) + trade-offs; (2) tables comparing candidate generator approaches; (3) cost-function templates; (4) deterministic DP/Viterbi pseudocode + complexity; (5) test harness design (golden MIDI, property tests, fuzz targets) + CI plan including pluginval-like checks; (6) integration notes for RT-safe operator pipeline + serialization/migrations; (7) prioritized prototyping backlog (impact vs effort + dependencies). Include 2 mermaid diagrams: data-flow and operator integration timeline."}
