# Vision Lab (R&D Sandbox)

Welcome to the Vision Lab.

This section exists to protect imagination while protecting execution discipline.

Anything in this section is:
- 🚧 Experimental
- Not committed to roadmap
- Not guaranteed to ship
- Subject to feasibility validation (RT safety, UX clarity, market demand)

---

## Purpose

The Vision Lab is where we explore:

- Dream features
- Radical UX concepts
- Advanced algorithmic experiments
- Long-term differentiation bets
- AI-assisted or MIDI 2.0 future ideas
- Concepts that may require non-trivial R&D

This space allows creative thinking without polluting active specs.

## Rules of the Vision Lab

1. All entries must declare:
   - Status
   - Horizon (Near / Mid / Long term)
   - RT feasibility (Low risk / High risk / Unknown)
   - Engineering complexity (Low / Medium / High / Extreme)

2. No Vision Lab concept may move into Feature Guide without:
   - A feasibility analysis
   - RT safety validation
   - UX simplification pass
   - Clear user value narrative

3. If an idea survives multiple dev cycles and gains traction, it may be promoted to:
   - Feature Spec
   - ADR
   - Roadmap item

## Categories

- Dream Features
- Dream UI / UX
- Experimental Algorithms
- Differentiation Bets
- Moonshots

## Why This Exists

Great products require bold thinking.

But bold thinking without discipline creates chaos.

The Vision Lab lets us do both.
