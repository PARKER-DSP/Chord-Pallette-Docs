# Chord Palette Plugin: Technical and Market Strategy Report

Date: 2026-02-13  
Method: Codebase-first audit plus previously collected competitor/source notes. No new research was performed for this draft.

## 1. Executive Summary

This product is not just a chord generator. The current codebase is a low-latency MIDI chord performance engine with composition utilities layered on top.

Key conclusion:
- Strongest strategic wedge is live harmonic performance on pads/keys/controllers, not direct head-to-head theory browsing against Scaler-style products.
- Core moat is the combination of real-time trigger mapping, safe-note remapping, rapid chord-bank manipulation, and practical MIDI export workflows.
- Product already supports a path to ecosystem revenue via presets, controller profiles, and community chord sharing without major architectural rewrites.

Top priorities:
1. Position category around performance mapping and fast harmonic control.
2. Productize controller-first workflows (profiles, scenes, setlists, low-friction live UX).
3. Ship a free lead magnet (Lite plugin or web tool) that demonstrates "one-note to full progression" in under 60 seconds.
4. Build recurring value via content ecosystem before heavy AI investment.
