# 🎹 Voice Leading — The Secret to Chords That *Flow*

You don't just want chords.  
You want movement.

You trigger a progression…  
But instead of sounding connected, it jumps.  
Blocky. Mechanical. MIDI.

Voice Leading fixes that.

## What It Does

Voice Leading intelligently connects one chord to the next by smoothly moving each note to the closest, most musical destination.

Instead of:

**Cmaj7 → Fmaj7**  
(notes jumping awkwardly across octaves)

You get:

**Cmaj7 → Fmaj7**  
(notes sliding naturally, shared tones preserved, bass grounded)

The result?

✨ **Chords that breathe**  
✨ **Transitions that feel intentional**  
✨ **Progressions that tell a story**

## Why It Matters

Great harmony isn't just about *what* chord comes next.

It's about *how* it gets there.

Film composers use it.  
Neo-soul players rely on it.  
Classical composers mastered it centuries ago.  

Now it's built directly into your performance workflow.
