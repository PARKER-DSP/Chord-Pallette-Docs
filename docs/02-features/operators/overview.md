Operators are modular, non-destructive transforms that shape harmony output without rewriting base chord definitions.

## Why Operators Exist

- isolate musical transforms into composable units
- allow reversible experimentation
- support style presets and workflow reuse

## Operator Documentation Map

- [Operator System](operator-system.md) for core design contracts.
- [Operator Catalog](operator-catalog.md) for current operator inventory.
- [Voice Leading Overview](../voice-leading/overview.md) for transition-focused behavior.

## Architecture Dependencies

- [Architecture Principles](../../01-developer/architecture/architecture-principles.md)
- [Realtime Safety](../../01-developer/architecture/realtime-safety.md)
