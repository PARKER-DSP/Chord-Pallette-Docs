# Chord Features Overview

ChordPallette's core capabilities are organized around how chords are captured, managed, transformed, and performed.

---

## Key Feature Areas

### [Voice Leading](voice-leading/)

The sophisticated heart of ChordPallette. Voice leading ensures that chord transitions feel smooth and musical, with natural note movement from one chord to the next.

**Includes:**
- [Overview](voice-leading/overview.md) – What voice leading is and why it matters
- [Operator Pack UX](voice-leading/operator-pack-ux.md) – How users interact with voice leading styles

---

### [Operators](operators/)

Modular, non-destructive transforms applied to chords. Operators handle everything from voicing decisions (inversions, spreads) to performance behaviors (arpeggios, humanization).

**Includes:**
- [Operator System](operators/operator-system.md) – Architecture and design principles
- [Operator Catalog](operators/operator-catalog.md) – Complete list of available operators
